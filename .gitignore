# =============== Asset Store EULA Protection ===============
# 1. Ignore ALL contents of the Assets folder by default
/Assets/*

# 2. Re-include ONLY your original work folder
# Replace "_MyProject" with your actual folder name
!/Assets/_MyProject/
!/Assets/_MyProject/**

# 3. CRITICAL: Allow .meta files for the top-level folders 
# (Required so Unity doesn't break scene references)
!/Assets/*.meta

# 4. Explicitly ensure the 3D Stealth Game & Samples are ignored
Assets/_3DStealthGame/
Assets/TextMesh Pro/
Assets/TutorialInfo/
Assets/Standard Assets/

# =============== Project Settings ===============
